                    <p>
                        Nadia Danett is an educator who taught her native Russian language to high school students for
                        nearly four decades at the independent St. Louis Country Day School (now MICDS) in Missouri.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a teacher and adviser, Danett’s influence on her students moved far beyond language into
                        culture, history, and the arts. In an historically all-male environment, she also gave love,
                        compassion and encouragement to boys who thrived under her inspiring and generous guidance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ​

                        For years, Danett told only fragments of her remarkable life story beginning in Poland in 1924,
                        continuing through the ravages of World War II in Eastern Europe, her journey with husband
                        Chester to America in 1948, and to the success and happiness they both found in their adopted
                        country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ​

                        In this revealing memoir, the entire story is told at last – a story of drama, devotion, hope
                        and humor rarely diminished during times of trial, and a series of astonishing miracles both
                        large and small.

                    <p>

                        Nadia Danett’s story is a beacon to anyone seeking demonstrable evidence of the power of faith,
                        and its deliverance from darkness into light.

                        SYNOPSIS
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        In this extraordinary memoir, the life story of Nadia Danett is one of survival, faith, and
                        miracle after miracle in the midst of the contradictory alliances of World War II. It is also
                        the story of an inspiring love that endured through war’s horrors and terrors; the legacy and
                        inspiration of selfless people in the midst of trial and chaos; and the promise of America and
                        two immigrants’ pathways to success in a new homeland.

                <div class="l-box pure-u-1-2">
                    <p>Russian-born Nadia Danett grew up in Poland under the watchful and generous guidance of her
                        maternal grandmother, who nurtured her in the Russian Orthodox faith. She married Chesia, a
                        wealthy, handsome Russian from another social level entirely, and both bristled under Soviet
                        rule – her mother, and his father, were jailed by the Soviets; her mother for pro-Ukrainian
                        leanings and his father falsely accused of being “an enemy of the people.” The couple also was
                        buffeted by the brutalities of Germans (and endangered their lives by hiding a Jewish family en
                        route to Palestine), and experienced and survived a number of unthinkable horrors at the hands
                        of Polish, Ukrainian, and Czech partisans.</p>

                    <p>At war’s end, they were housed at a United Nations refugee camp until frustration caused them to
                        leave and strike out on their own. For a time, Chesia was employed at Gen. Dwight D.
                        Eisenhower’s headquarters in postwar Germany. The couple’s dream was to get away from Europe and
                        war, but they had no family or sponsors in the United States. The advice of a kindly Army
                        captain led them to a pathway to America and citizenship.

                    <p>
                        Settling in St. Louis, Missouri, having a son, and living through the tensions of the Cold War,
                        the Danetts attended Washington University and both received impressive degrees. Nadia Danett
                        became a teacher at a prestigious private school, teaching Russian, German, and French to
                        students for 39 years – the happiest years of her life.

                    <p>
                        Beyond the blessings of her family and career, Nadia Danett’s story ultimately is about how
                        goodness prevails in the face of unimaginable horror, how humor can endure even after trial and
                        tragedy – and how faith in God can lead to one miracle after another.</p>
